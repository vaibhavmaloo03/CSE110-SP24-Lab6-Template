Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

Option: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
Automated tests should be integrated into the continuous integration (CI) pipeline, specifically within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This ensures that every change is automatically tested before being merged into the main branch. It helps catch bugs early, maintains code quality, and reduces the risk of introducing errors into the production environment. Running tests on every push allows developers to receive immediate feedback on their changes, making it easier to identify and fix issues promptly.

Would you use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
